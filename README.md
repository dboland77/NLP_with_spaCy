# Advanced NLP with spaCy: A free online course

This repo contains both an [**online course**](https://course.spacy.io), as well
as a modern web framework for **building online courses** with interactive code,
slides and multiple-choice questions. In the course, you'll learn how to use
[spaCy](https://spacy.io) to build advanced natural language understanding
systems, using both rule-based and machine learning approaches.

I originally developed the content for DataCamp, but I wanted to make a free
version so you don't have to sign up for their service. As a weekend project, I
ended up putting together my own little app to present the exercises and content
in a fun and interactive way. The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org) üíñ

_This course is mostly intended for **self-study**. Yes, you can cheat ‚Äì the
solutions are all in this repo, there's no penalty for clicking "Show hints" or
"Show solution", and you can mark an exercise as done when you think it's done._

## ‚ú® Features

- Supports **slides**, **interactive code exercises** and **multiple-choice
  questions** pretty much out-of-the-box.
- Executes code live and validates user submissions with tests functions using
  Jupyter kernels via Binder.
- Allows authoring content in 100% Markdown with custom elements.
- Uses the `localStorage` to keep track of which exercises were already (marked
  as) completed.
- Runs super fast thanks to Gatsby and uses all the hip and modern web stuff
  like React Hooks, GraphQL and service workers under the hood.
- Is open-source and published under the MIT license (code and framework) and CC
  BY-NC (spaCy course materials).

## üíÅ FAQ

**So should I not take your DataCamp course anymore?** Probably not, no.

**Can I use this to build my own course?** Probably, yes! If you've been looking
for a DIY way to publish your materials, I hope that my little framework can be
useful. Because so many people expressed interest in this, I put together some
[starter repos](#starter-repos-for-your-own-course) that you can fork and adapt.

**Why the different licenses?** The source of the app, UI components and Gatsby
framework for building interactive courses is licensed as MIT, like pretty much
all of my open-source software. The course materials themselves (slides and
chapters), are licensed under CC BY-NC. This means that you can use them freely
‚Äì you just can't make money off them.

## üéõ Usage & API

I mostly built this project for my own course, but it should be very easy to
fork and adapt. I made sure to strictly separate the content and the app
functionality and source. So if you want to fork the repo and create your own
course, you should only have to edit the chapters, exercises and `meta.json`,
update the visual assets in `/static` and optionally adjust the theme colours.
In theory, it should even work for languages other than Python ‚Äì but I haven't
tested this yet. You can then build your repo with
[Binder](https://mybinder.org) and deploy it via something like
[Netlify](https://netlify.com).

### How it works

When building the site, Gatsby will look for `.py` files and make their contents
available to query via GraphQL. This lets us use the raw code within the app.
Under the hood, the app uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org) to serve up an image
with the package dependencies, including the spaCy models. By calling into
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), we can then execute
code using the active kernel. This lets you edit the code in the browser and see
the live results. Also see my [`juniper`](https://github.com/ines/juniper) repo
for more details on the implementation.

To validate the code when the user hits "Submit", I'm currently using a slightly
hacky trick. Since the Python code is sent back to the kernel as a string, we
can manipulate it and add tests ‚Äì for example, exercise `exc_01_02_01.py` will
be validated using `test_01_02_01.py` (if available). The user code and test are
combined using a string template. At the moment, the `testTemplate` in the
`meta.json` looks like this:

```
from wasabi import Printer
__msg__ = Printer()
__solution__ = """${solution}"""
${solution}

${test}
try:
    test()
except AssertionError as e:
    __msg__.fail(e)
```

If present, `${solution}` will be replaced with the string value of the
submitted user code. In this case, we're inserting it twice: once as a string so
we can check whether the submission includes something, and once as the code, so
we can actually run it and check the objects it creates. `${test}` is replaced
by the contents of the test file. I'm also making
[`wasabi`](https://github.com/ines/wasabi)'s printer available as `__msg__`, so
we can easily print pretty messages in the tests. Finally, the `try`/`accept`
block checks if the test function raises an `AssertionError` and if so, displays
the error message. This also hides the full error traceback (which can easily
leak the correct answers).

A test file could then look like this:

```python
def test():
    assert "spacy.load" in __solution__, "Are you calling spacy.load?"
    assert nlp.meta["lang"] == "en", "Are you loading the correct model?"
    assert nlp.meta["name"] == "core_web_sm", "Are you loading the correct model?"
    assert "nlp(text)" in __solution__, "Are you processing the text correctly?"
    assert "print(doc.text)" in __solution__, "Are you printing the Doc's text?"

    __msg__.good(
        "Well done! Now that you've practiced loading models, let's look at "
        "some of their predictions."
    )
```

With this approach, it's not _always_ possible to validate the input perfectly ‚Äì
there are too many options and we want to avoid false positives.

#### Running automated tests

The automated tests make sure that the provided solution code is compatible with
the test file that's used to validate submissions. The test suite is powered by
the [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework and runnable test
files are generated automatically in a directory `__tests__` before the test
session starts. See the [`conftest.py`](conftest.py) for implementation details.

```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r binder/requirements.txt
# Run the tests (will generate the files automatically)
python -m pytest __tests__
```

### Directory Structure

```yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ binder
|   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Python dependency requirements for Binder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapters              # chapters, one Markdown file per chapter
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercises             # code files, tests and assets for exercises
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public                # compiled site
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ slides                # slides, one Markdown file per presentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src                   # Gatsby/React source, independent from content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static                # static assets like images, available in slides/chapters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meta.json             # course metadata
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.sass            # UI theme colors and settings
```

### Setting up Binder

The [`requirements.txt`](binder/requirements.txt) in the repository defines the
packages that are installed when building it with Binder. For this course, I'm
using the source repo as the Binder repo, as it allows to keep everything in
once place. It also lets the exercises reference and load other files (e.g.
JSON), which will be copied over into the Pyt hon environment. I build the
binder from a branch `binder`, though, which I only update if Binder-relevant
files change. Otherwise, every update to `master` would trigger an image
rebuild.

You can specify the binder settings like repo, branch and kernel type in the
`"juniper"` section of the `meta.json`. I'd recommend running the very first
build via the interface on the [Binder website](https://mybinder.org), as this
gives you a detailed build log and feedback on whether everything worked as
expected. Enter your repository URL, click "launch" and wait for it to install
the dependencies and build the image.

### Running the app

To start the local development server, install [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
and then all other dependencies.

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli  # Install Gatsby globally
npm install                # Install dependencies
npm run dev                # Run the development server
```

For hosting, I recommend [Netlify](https://netlify.com). It works with GitHub
and Gatsby out-of-the-box.

### File formats

#### Chapters

Chapters are placed in [`/chapters`](/chapters) and are Markdown files
consisting of `<exercise>` components. They'll be turned into pages, e.g.
`/chapter1`. In their frontmatter block at the top of the file, they need to
specify `type: chapter`, as well as the following meta:

```yaml
---
title: The chapter title
description: The chapter description
prev: /chapter1 # exact path to previous chapter or null to not show a link
next: /chapter3 # exact path to next chapter or null to not show a link
id: 2 # unique identifier for chapter
type: chapter # important: this creates a standalone page from the chapter
---

```

#### Slides

Slides are placed in [`/slides`](/slides) and are markdown files consisting of
slide content, separated by `---`. They need to specify the following
frontmatter block at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
type: slides
---

```

The **first and last slide** use a special layout and will display the headline
in the center of the slide. **Speaker notes** (in this case, the script) can be
added at the end of a slide, prefixed by `Notes:`. They'll then be shown on the
right next to the slides. Here's an example slides file:

```markdown
---
type: slide
---

# Processing pipelines

Notes: This is a slide deck about processing pipelines.

---

# Next slide

- Some bullet points here
- And another bullet point

<img src="/image.jpg" alt="An image located in /static" />
```

### Custom Elements

When using custom elements, make sure to place a newline between the
opening/closing tags and the children. Otherwise, Markdown content may not
render correctly.

## üõ£ Roadmap and todos

- [ ] Front-end tests. Also, if someone wants to port this over to TypeScript,
      I'd accept the PR üòõ
- [ ] PDF slides. Since the app is using Reveal.js, this should be possible.
- [ ] Testing it for other languages like R. I'd be really curious to see if it
      works. We'd have to adjust the
      [`node.extension` check here](gatsby-node.js) for other files to be
      included via GraphQL.
