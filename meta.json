    "description": "In this course, you'll learn how to use spaCy to build advanced natural language understanding systems, using both rule-based and machine learning approaches. I originally developed the content for DataCamp, but I wanted to make a free version so you don't have to sign up for their service. As a weekend project, I ended up putting together my own little app to present the exercises and content in a fun and interactive way.",
